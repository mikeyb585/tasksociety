# tasksociety
A lightweight productivity tool that stores tasks

## Project Description
In this project I used Font Awesome provided by Bootstrap for the icons and Materialize CSS for the framework. I created this
application to get rid of sticky notes on my desk and desktop at work. The very fist thing I learned in programming is, to
find a problem and create a solution for it.
